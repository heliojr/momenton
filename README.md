# UI Test Cases 

The UI test automation framework is based on Selenium Java and Junit 4 and it is following the Page Object design pattern where each one of the pages in the web application has its own class with all the actions/iteractions defined as methods.

I have choosen www.myers.com.au as the e-commerce site for this test and have written automated test cases for 2 scenarios ( a product search and adding one product to the cart ) . Unfortunately, I have no time to write the test for the third scenario.
